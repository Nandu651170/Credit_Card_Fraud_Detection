**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of European cardholders' transactions from September 2013. Given the significant class imbalance, various resampling techniques and machine learning models were employed to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Key Steps:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified patterns and distribution of features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardized and cleaned the data.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Applied under-sampling and over-sampling techniques like SMOTE.
- **Modeling:** Built and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized models using grid search and cross-validation.
- **Deployment:** Serialized the best model (XGBoost) for easy deployment.

**Results:**
Achieved high performance metrics, especially in precision and recall, crucial for effective fraud detection.
